      <p id="about-text">
        Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 â€“ December 20, 1996) was an American
        astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist,
        astrobiologist, science communicator, author, and professor. His best
        known scientific contribution is his research on the possibility of
        extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the
        production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. He
        assembled the first physical messages sent into space, the Pioneer
        plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, which were universal messages that
        could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence
        that might find them. He argued in favor of the hypothesis, which has
        since been accepted, that the high surface temperatures of Venus are the
        result of the greenhouse effect.
